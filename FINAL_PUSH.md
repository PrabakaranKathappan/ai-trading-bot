# ✅ Final Step: Push Code to GitHub

## 🎉 Great Progress!

✅ Git installed and configured  
✅ Repository initialized with 35 files  
✅ GitHub repository created: https://github.com/PrabakaranKathappan/ai-trading-bot  
✅ Personal Access Token generated  

## 📋 Last Step: Copy Token and Push

### Step 1: Copy Your Token

Look at your browser - you should see a green token starting with `ghp_...`

**IMPORTANT:** Click the copy icon next to the token to copy it. You won't be able to see this token again!

### Step 2: Run the Push Command

Open PowerShell and run this command:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Prabakaran K\Documents\antigravity_apps\AiTradingBot"
& 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe' push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enter Credentials When Prompted

**Username**: `PrabakaranKathappan`

**Password**: Paste the token you just copied (it won't show as you paste - that's normal!)

Press Enter and your code will be pushed!

## ✨ After Push Completes

Your code will be live on GitHub at:
**https://github.com/PrabakaranKathappan/ai-trading-bot**

### What's Protected (Not Uploaded)
- ❌ `.env` file (your API keys are safe!)
- ❌ Database files
- ❌ Log files

### Next Steps
